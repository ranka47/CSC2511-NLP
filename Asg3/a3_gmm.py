        As you'll see in tutorial, for efficiency, you can precompute something for 'm' that applies to all x outside of this function.
        If you do this, you pass that precomputed component in preComputedForM

        X can be training data, when used in train( ... ), and
        X can be testing data, when used in test( ... ).

        We don't actually pass X directly to the function because we instead pass:

        log_Bs(m,t) is the log probability of vector x_t in component m, which is computed and stored outside of this function for efficiency.
