	This function reads data from data_dir, computes unigram and bigram counts,
	and writes the result to fn_LM
	
	INPUTS:
	
    data_dir	: (string) The top-level directory continaing the data from which
					to train or decode. e.g., '/u/cs401/A2_SMT/data/Toy/'
	language	: (string) either 'e' (English) or 'f' (French)
	fn_LM		: (string) the location to save the language model once trained
    
    OUTPUT
	
	LM			: (dictionary) a specialized language model
	
	The file fn_LM must contain the data structured called "LM", which is a dictionary
	having two fields: 'uni' and 'bi', each of which holds sub-structures which 
	incorporate unigram or bigram counts
	
	e.g., LM['uni']['word'] = 5 		# The word 'word' appears 5 times
		  LM['bi']['word']['bird'] = 2 	# The bigram 'word bird' appears 2 times.
